My name is Dawid and I am graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, during my time at university I concentrated on completing various technical projects which I am very proud of. 
One of these was: A Mobile application in Java centred around keeping track of the user's thoughts through notes and mental wellbeing. Also, for my dissertation I constructed A virtual reality education application in Unreal Engine 4 with the aim to educate students going through their GCSE's about mathematical concepts such as 3D geometry.
With projects like those, I successfully achieved an overall High 21 for my degree.
Before university I undertook a 2-year study to complete a level 3 extended diploma in Information technology, I pursued this because I have always had a big passion for technology and its ever-advancing nature.
Going forward with my professional career, I decided that dev ops is a perfect way for me to start within the technical industry. I know it will enable me to learn a variety of different technical and interpersonal skills in-order to push my professional career within the right direction.
Sparta global seems to share the same kind of values I find important within an organisation and that is why I know this is the right path for me.
